<h1>HOW TO USE METANOTES LIKE A PRO:</h1>

<p>
Here are some tips about how you
can make MetaNotes.com <i>yours</i>.
</p>

<h2>1) Add pictures to your spaces fast!</h2>

<p>
If you see a picture on the Internet you
like, why not include it in one of your
spaces? You can easily make collections
of images from all over the Web that
you can share with anyone.
</p>

<p>
To place an image in a note, get its
URL and just use this simple format:
</p>

<pre>
!URL!
</pre>

<p>
To get an image's URL in Firefox, just
right-click it to "Copy Image Location".
</p>

<p>
Then create a new note, and quickly
type ! then [Ctrl-V] then ! then TAB.
Don't enter any spaces in there!  :)
</p>


<h2>2) Use bullet points to make lots of lists.</h2>

<p>
To make a bullet point list, use stars
(aka asterisks - shift-8 on your keyboard):
</p>

<pre>
My Favorite Bands

* Stereolab
* The Wu-Tang Clan
* The Minutemen
* Unwound
* Black Sabbath
</pre>

<p>
For sub-bullets, simply add more stars:
</p>

<pre>
To Do List

* Finish help docs
** Graphical
** Text
* Buy printer paper
** Get highlighters too
</pre>


<h2>3) Make text in notes bigger than normal.</h2>

<pre>
h1. This text will be Extra-Extra-Large.

h2. This text will be Extra-Large.

h3. This text will be Large.
</pre>

<p>
This way you can add emphasis to a key
phrase you want to call out on a space.
</p>


<h2>4) Bold and italicize your text.</h2>

<p>
Surround the text to bold with stars:
</p>

<pre>
Hey everyone!  I said, *HEY, EVERYONE!!!*
</pre>

<p>
Use underscores to italicize bits of text:
</p>

<pre>
I am re-reading _Brave New World._
</pre>


<h2>5) Link out to other Web pages.</h2>

<p>
The syntax is this:
</p>

<pre>
"Link Description":URL
</pre>

<p>
For instance,
</p>

<pre>
"Buy Stickers":http://www.stickernation.com
</pre>


<h2>6) Change the color of your notes !!!</h2>

<p>
Use the "contextual menu" that pops out
of the icon on the bottom left of your screen
and select the "color" menu item.
</p>

<p>
You'll need to understand HEX color code to
change the color of a note.  Some common
colors are:
</p>

<pre>
Black = #000000
White = #FFFFFF
Yellow = #FFFF00
Red = #FF0000
</pre>


<h2>6) Invite other users to collaborate.</h2>

<p>
Just send them the URL of the space!
Once they get a free account, they can
add notes to your spaces in real-time.
That means you see their notes pop up
and change while you watch. It's cool.
</p>


<h2>7) Use the TIME LOG !!!!</h2>

<p>
The Time Log is a great way to keep track of
what you're going through.  It's like a PRIVATE
version of Twitter.  Enter ideas or events in
there as they occur.  Then you'll get this cool
history list which will help you remember just
about everything that happens to you.  I use
the Time Log just about all the time.  Just
click the clock icon in the top right corner
and log in with your MetaNotes password.
</p>

<h2>8) Use TWITTER !!!</h2>

<p>
Twitter is the CB radio of MetaNotes!  Use
Twitter to find your friends (near the bottom
of the Twitter panel).  Then answer the eternal
question - "What are you doing right now?" All
your Twitter followers will hear your broadcast.
</p>

<p>
To start an account, go to http://www.twitter.com.
</p>

<h2>9) Start TONS of spaces for ALL KINDS OF THINGS.</h2>

<p>
You can track just about any research topic in
MetaNotes.  We do all of our planning on MetaNotes
and we believe it is why we're so effective as a
collaborative team.
</p>

<p>
Remember, we're an open space: other people can
surf into your pages, so expect collaboration!
</p>

<h2>10) Discover your friends' pages!!!</h2>

<p>
Get their username and point your browser to:
http://www.metanotes.com/username
</p>


<h2>11) Bookmark your individual spaces!!!</h2>

<p>
You can create links in your Bookmarks Toolbar
in your browser so that you can revisit certain
spaces very fast while browsing elsewhere.
</p>

<h2>12) Use the GMAIL panel !!!</h2>

<p>
If you have a Gmail account, you can check your
email while you work in MetaNotes.  You can even
copy-paste your emails into MetaNotes to keep a
wall of important, timeless, or classic emails that
you receive.  It's a great way to remember them!
